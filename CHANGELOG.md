# Stella 1.0 (initial version)

This version is very important since it defines further development of the entire project. Many decisions were done on library design, code style and other.

## Implemented in 1.0

- Wayland display connection routines.
- "xdg_shell" surfaces creation and event handling routines.
- Shared memory support.

## Plans for 1.1

- Add support for several displays.
- Add support for different shared memory buffers formats.
- Add double-buffering routines.
- Fix surface resizing issues.
- Switch "temporary_buffer_file" to XDG_RUNTIME_DIR.
